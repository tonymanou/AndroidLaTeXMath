The minimal JLaTeXMath distribution doesn't contain the fonts, they're in separate jars. This kind of distribution is useful for web applications and I wrote it for GeoGebra team, if you want register a new alphabet just use for example :

    WebStartAlphabetRegistration.register(AlphabetRegistration.JLM_GREEK);

the package jlm_greek.jar will be load if and only if greek language is present the text.
