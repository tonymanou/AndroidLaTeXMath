It is a simple example to show how to use JLaTeXMath from C++ in using Giws wrapper.
To run it:
i) make
ii) export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/amd64/server
iii) ./latex "\int_0^{+\infty} e^{-x^2}\mathrm{d}x = \frac\sqrt{\pi}2 \text{ and } \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^2}=\frac{\pi^2}6" foo.png

Depending of your configuration, you probably need to modify build.xml, Makefile and latex.cpp to adapt the different paths.

On Windows :
 - you must have a environment variable JAVA_HOME to your JDK folder ( ex : C:\Program Files\java\jdk )
 - ant must be in you PATH
 - jvm.dll must be in you PATH ( Ex : C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin\server )
